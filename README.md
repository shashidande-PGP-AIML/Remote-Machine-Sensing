The challenge of detecting gas leaks with mobile robots

In this body of work we describe the design, construction and validation of a mobile sensory platform for gas leak monitoring. The complete system consists of a sensory system on board a small quadrotor (i.e., a four rotor mini-UAV). The goals of this system include taking mesurements of gases
