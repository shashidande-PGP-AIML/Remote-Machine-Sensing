# Remote Machnine Sensing
The Challenge of detecting gas leaks with mobile robots.

### Introduction
In this body of work we describe the design, construction and validation of a mobile sensory platform for gas leak monitoring. The complete system consists of a sensory system on board a small quadrotor (i.e., a four rotor mini-UAV). The goals of this system include taking mesurements of gases, sensing and identifying their source. 

There are many design challenges in building a mobile sensory platform. Here are the main chanllenges we intend to address.

- Gas sensing and development of olfactory capability
