# Remote Machnine Sensing
The Challenge of detecting gas leaks with mobile robots.

### Introduction
In this body of work we describe the design, construction and validation of a mobile sensory platform for gas leak monitoring. The complete system consists of a sensory system on board a small quadrotor (i.e., a four rotor mini-UAV). The goals of this system include taking mesurements of gases, sensing and identifying their source. There are many challenges in building a mobile sensory platform. We have to pay special attention the robot perception and decisi√≥n-making processes and develop the capabilities necessary for an effcient, autonomous robot. In order to achive that we need to tackle the following design challenges. 
- Gas sensing and development of olfactory capability
- Design of perception, decision and actuation system
- Quadrotor's limited payload
- The sensors layout and placement in order to have the least possible influence of the rotors.

### Gas Sensing
Olfaction is a valuable source of information about the environment that has not been sufficiently exploited in mobile robotics yet. We claim that data provided by e-noses may have an important added-value when combined with other sensing modalities (particularly, vision), and also when olfaction is integrated into the robot high-level processes.

Gas sensing is the task of detecting volatile substances and providing a conversion of that information into a signal or electrical magnitude readable by an operator or instrument. In the field of artificial olfaction, devices that fullfill this task are known as Electronic noses.
